<p>  Clerk Colvill and his lusty dame<br>
    Were walking in the garden green;<br>
  The belt around her stately waist<br>
    Cost Clerk Colvill of pounds fifteen.</p>

<p>  "O promise me now, Clerk Colvill,<br>
    Or it will cost ye muckle strife,<br>
  Ride never by the wells of Slane,<br>
    If ye wad live and brook your life."</p>

<p>  "Now speak nae mair, my lusty dame,<br>
    Now speak nae mair of that to me;<br>
  Did I neer see a fair woman,<br>
    But I wad sin with her body?"</p>

<p>  He's taen leave o his gay lady,<br>
    Nought minding what his lady said,<br>
  And he's rode by the wells of Slane,<br>
    Where washing was a bonny maid.</p>

<p>  "Wash on, wash on, my bonny maid,<br>
    That wash sae clean your sark of silk;"<br>
  "And weel fa you, fair gentleman,<br>
    Your body whiter than the milk."</p>

<p>      *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  Then loud, loud cry'd the Clerk Colvill,<br>
    "O my head it pains me sair;"<br>
  "Then take, then take," the maiden said,<br>
    "And frae my sark you'll cut a gare."</p>

<p>  Then she's gied him a little bane-knife,<br>
    And frae her sark he cut a share;<br>
  She's ty'd it round his whey-white face,<br>
    But ay his head it aked mair.</p>

<p>  Then louder cry'd the Clerk Colville,<br>
    "O sairer, sairer akes my head;"<br>
  "And sairer, sairer ever will,"<br>
    The maiden crys, "till you be dead."</p>

<p>  Out then he drew his shining blade,<br>
    Thinking to stick her where she stood,<br>
  But she was vanished to a fish,<br>
    And swam far off, a fair mermaid.</p>

<p>  "O mother, mother, braid my hair;<br>
    My lusty lady, make my bed;<br>
  O brother, take my sword and spear,<br>
    For I have seen the false mermaid."</p>

<br><br>

<p>  Our king he kept a false stew&agrave;rde,<br>
    Sir Aldingar they him call;<br>
  A falser steward than he was one,<br>
    Servde not in bower nor hall.</p>

<p>  He wolde have layne by our comelye queene,<br>
    Her deere worshippe to betraye:<br>
  Our queene she was a good wom&agrave;n,<br>
    And evermore said him naye.</p>

<p>  Sir Aldingar was wrothe in his mind,<br>
    With her hee was never content,<br>
  Till traiterous meanes he colde devyse,<br>
    In a fyer to have her brent.</p>

<p>  There came a lazar to the kings gate,<br>
    A lazar both blinde and lame:<br>
  He tooke the lazar upon his backe,<br>
    Him on the queenes bed has layne.</p>

<p>  "Lye still, lazar, whereas thou lyest,<br>
    Looke thou goe not hence away;<br>
  He make thee a whole man and a sound<br>
    In two howers of the day."</p>

<p>  Then went him forth Sir Aldingar,<br>
    And hyed him to our king:<br>
  "If I might have grace, as I have space,<br>
    Sad tydings I could bring."</p>

<p>  Say on, say on, Sir Aldingar,<br>
    Saye on the soothe to mee.<br>
  "Our queene hath chosen a new new love,<br>
    And shee will have none of thee.</p>

<p>  "If shee had chosen a right good knight,<br>
    The lesse had beene her shame;<br>
  But she hath chose her a lazar man,<br>
    A lazar both blinde and lame."</p>

<p>  If this be true, thou Aldingar,<br>
    The tyding thou tellest to me,<br>
  Then will I make thee a rich rich knight,<br>
    Rich both of golde and fee.</p>

<p>  But if it be false, Sir Aldingar,<br>
    As God nowe grant it bee!<br>
  Thy body, I sweare by the holye rood,<br>
    Shall hang on the gallows tree.</p>

<p>  He brought our king to the queenes chamb&egrave;r,<br>
    And opend to him the dore.<br>
  A lodlye love, King Harry says,<br>
    For our queene dame Elinore!</p>

<p>  If thou were a man, as thou art none,<br>
    Here on my sword thoust dye;<br>
  But a payre of new gallowes shall be built,<br>
    And there shalt thou hang on hye.</p>

<p>  Forth then hyed our king, I wysse,<br>
    And an angry man was hee;<br>
  And soone he found Queen Elinore,<br>
    That bride so bright of blee.</p>

<p>  Now God you save, our queene, madame,<br>
    And Christ you save and see;<br>
  Heere you have chosen a newe newe love,<br>
    And you will have none of mee.</p>

<p>  If you had chosen a right good knight,<br>
    The lesse had been your shame;<br>
  But you have chose you a lazar man,<br>
    A lazar both blinde and lame.</p>

<p>  Therfore a fyer there shalt be built,<br>
    And brent all shalt thou bee.--<br>
  Now out alacke! said our comly queene,<br>
    Sir Aldingar's false to mee.</p>

<p>  Now out alacke! sayd our comlye queene,<br>
    My heart with griefe will brast.<br>
  I had thought swevens had never been true;<br>
    I have proved them true at last.</p>

<p>  I dreamt in my sweven on Thursday eve,<br>
    In my bed whereas I laye.<br>
  I dreamt a grype and a grimlie beast<br>
    Had carryed my crowne awaye;</p>

<p>  My gorgett and my kirtle of golde,<br>
    And all my faire head-geere:<br>
  And he wold worrye me with his tush<br>
    And to his nest y-beare:</p>

<p>  Saving there came a little 'gray' hawke,<br>
    A merlin him they call,<br>
  Which untill the grounde did strike the grype,<br>
    That dead he downe did fall.</p>

<p>  Giffe I were a man, as now I am none,<br>
    A battell wold I prove,<br>
  To fight with that traitor Aldingar,<br>
    Att him I cast my glove.</p>

<p>  But seeing Ime able noe battell to make,<br>
    My liege, grant me a knight<br>
  To fight with that traitor Sir Aldingar,<br>
    To maintaine me in my right.</p>

<p>  "Now forty dayes I will give thee<br>
    To seeke thee a knight therein:<br>
  If thou find not a knight in forty dayes<br>
    Thy bodye it must brenn."</p>

<p>  Then shee sent east, and shee sent west,<br>
    By north and south bedeene:<br>
  But never a champion colde she find,<br>
    Wolde fight with that knight soe keene.</p>

<p>  Now twenty dayes were spent and gone,<br>
    Noe helpe there might be had;<br>
  Many a teare shed our comelye queene<br>
    And aye her hart was sad.</p>

<p>  Then came one of the queenes dams&egrave;lles,<br>
    And knelt upon her knee,<br>
  "Cheare up, cheare up, my gracious dame,<br>
    I trust yet helpe may be:</p>

<p>  And here I will make mine avowe,<br>
    And with the same me binde;<br>
  That never will I return to thee,<br>
    Till I some helpe may finde."</p>

<p>  Then forth she rode on a faire palfr&agrave;ye<br>
    Oer hill and dale about:<br>
  But never a champion colde she finde,<br>
    Wolde fighte with that knight so stout.</p>

<p>  And nowe the daye drewe on a pace,<br>
    When our good queene must dye;<br>
  All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    When she found no helpe was nye.</p>

<p>  All woe-begone was that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    And the salt teares fell from her eye:<br>
  When lo! as she rode by a rivers side,<br>
    She met with a tinye boye.</p>

<p>  A tinye boye she mette, God wot,<br>
    All clad in mantle of golde;<br>
  He seemed noe more in mans liken&egrave;sse,<br>
    Then a childe of four yeere old.</p>

<p>  Why grieve you, damselle faire, he sayd,<br>
    And what doth cause you moane?<br>
  The damsell scant wolde deigne a looke,<br>
    But fast she pricked on.</p>

<p>  Yet turne againe, thou faire dams&egrave;lle<br>
    And greete thy queene from mee:<br>
  When bale is att hyest, boote is nyest,<br>
    Nowe helpe enoughe may bee.</p>

<p>  Bid her remember what she dreamt<br>
    In her bedd, wheras shee laye;<br>
  How when the grype and grimly beast<br>
    Wolde have carried her crowne awaye,</p>

<p>  Even then there came the little gray hawke,<br>
    And saved her from his clawes:<br>
  Then bidd the queene be merry at hart,<br>
    For heaven will fende her cause.</p>

<p>  Back then rode that faire dams&egrave;lle,<br>
    And her hart it lept for glee:<br>
  And when she told her gracious dame<br>
    A gladd woman then was shee:</p>

<p>  But when the appointed day was come,<br>
    No helpe appeared nye:<br>
  Then woeful, woeful was her hart,<br>
    And the teares stood in her eye.</p>

<p>  And nowe a fyer was built of wood;<br>
    And a stake was made of tree;<br>
  And now Queene Elinor forth was led,<br>
    A sorrowful sight to see.</p>

<p>  Three times the herault he waved his hand,<br>
    And three times spake on hye:<br>
  Giff any good knight will fende this dame,<br>
    Come forth, or shee must dye.</p>

<p>  No knight stood forth, no knight there came,<br>
    No helpe appeared nye:<br>
  And now the fyer was lighted up,<br>
    Queen Elinor she must dye.</p>

<p>  And now the fyer was lighted up,<br>
    As hot as hot might bee;<br>
  When riding upon a little white steed,<br>
    The tinye boy they see.</p>

<p>  "Away with that stake, away with those brands,<br>
    And loose our comelye queene:<br>
  I am come to fight with Sir Aldingar,<br>
    And prove him a traitor keene."</p>

<p>  Forthe then stood Sir Aldingar,<br>
    But when he saw the chylde,<br>
  He laughed, and scoffed, and turned his backe,<br>
    And weened he had been beguylde.</p>

<p>  "Now turne, now turne thee, Aldingar,<br>
    And eyther fighte or flee;<br>
  I trust that I shall avenge the wronge,<br>
    Thoughe I am so small to see."</p>

<p>  The boy pulld forth a well good sworde<br>
    So gilt it dazzled the ee;<br>
  The first stroke stricken at Aldingar,<br>
    Smote off his leggs by the knee.</p>

<p>  "Stand up, stand up, thou false trait&ograve;r,<br>
    And fight upon thy feete,<br>
  For and thou thrive, as thou begin'st,<br>
    Of height wee shall be meete."</p>

<p>  A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,<br>
    While I am a man alive.<br>
  A priest, a priest, sayes Alding&agrave;r,<br>
    Me for to houzle and shrive.</p>

<p>  I wolde have laine by our comlie queene,<br>
    Bot shee wolde never consent;<br>
  Then I thought to betraye her unto our kinge<br>
    In a fyer to have her brent.</p>

<p>  There came a lazar to the kings gates,<br>
    A lazar both blind and lame:<br>
  I tooke the lazar upon my backe,<br>
    And on her bedd had him layne.</p>

<p>  Then ranne I to our comlye king,<br>
    These tidings sore to tell.<br>
  But ever alacke! sayes Aldingar,<br>
    Falsing never doth well.</p>

<p>  Forgive, forgive me, queene, madame,<br>
    The short time I must live.<br>
  "Nowe Christ forgive thee, Aldingar,<br>
    As freely I forgive."</p>

<p>  Here take thy queene, our king Harry&egrave;,<br>
    And love her as thy life,<br>
  For never had a king in Christentye.<br>
    A truer and fairer wife.</p>

<p>  King Henrye ran to claspe his queene,<br>
    And loosed her full sone:<br>
  Then turned to look for the tinye boye;<br>
    --The boye was vanisht and gone.</p>

<p>  But first he had touched the lazar man,<br>
    And stroakt him with his hand:<br>
  The lazar under the gallowes tree<br>
    All whole and sounde did stand.</p>

<p>  The lazar under the gallowes tree<br>
    Was comelye, straight and tall;<br>
  King Henrye made him his head stew&agrave;rde<br>
    To wayte withinn his hall.</p>

    The hunting of that day.</p>

<p>  The stout Erle of Northumberland<br>
    A vow to God did make,<br>
  His pleasure in the Scottish woods<br>
    Three summers days to take;</p>

<p>  The cheefest harts in Chevy-chace<br>
    To kill and beare away.<br>
  These tydings to Erle Douglas came,<br>
    In Scotland where he lay:</p>

<p>  Who sent Erle Percy present word,<br>
    He wold prevent his sport.<br>
  The English erle, not fearing that,<br>
    Did to the woods resort</p>

<p>  With fifteen hundred bow-men bold;<br>
    All chosen men of might,<br>
  Who knew full well in time of neede<br>
    To ayme their shafts arright.</p>

<p>  The galland greyhounds swiftly ran,<br>
    To chase the fallow deere:<br>
  On munday they began to hunt,<br>
    Ere day-light did appeare;</p>

<p>  And long before high noone they had<br>
    An hundred fat buckes slaine;<br>
  Then having dined, the drovyers went<br>
    To rouze the deare againe.</p>

<p>  The bow-men mustered on the hills,<br>
    Well able to endure;<br>
  Theire backsides all, with speciall care,<br>
    That day were guarded sure.</p>

<p>  The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,<br>
    The nimble deere to take,<br>
  That with their cryes the hills and dales<br>
    An eccho shrill did make.</p>

<p>  Lord Percy to the quarry went,<br>
    To view the slaughter'd deere;<br>
  Quoth he, Erle Douglas promised<br>
    This day to meet me heere:</p>

<p>  But if I thought he wold not come,<br>
    Noe longer wold I stay.<br>
  With that, a brave younge gentleman<br>
    Thus to the Erle did say:</p>

<p>  Loe, yonder doth Erle Douglas come,<br>
    His men in armour bright;<br>
  Full twenty hundred Scottish speres<br>
    All marching in our sight;</p>

<p>  All men of pleasant Tivydale,<br>
    Fast by the river Tweede:<br>
  O cease your sports, Erle Percy said,<br>
    And take your bowes with speede:</p>

<p>  And now with me, my countrymen,<br>
    Your courage forth advance;<br>
  For there was never champion yett,<br>
    In Scotland nor in France,</p>

<p>  That ever did on horsebacke come,<br>
    But if my hap it were,<br>
  I durst encounter man for man,<br>
    With him to break a spere.</p>

<p>  Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,<br>
    Most like a baron bolde,<br>
  Rode foremost of his company,<br>
    Whose armour shone like gold.</p>

<p>  Show me, sayd hee, whose men you bee,<br>
    That hunt soe boldly heere,<br>
  That, without my consent, doe chase<br>
    And kill my fallow-deere.</p>

<p>  The first man that did answer make<br>
    Was noble Percy hee;<br>
  Who sayd, Wee list not to declare,<br>
    Nor shew whose men wee bee:<br></p>

<p>  Yet wee will spend our deerest blood,<br>
    Thy cheefest harts to slay.<br>
  Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe,<br>
    And thus in rage did say,</p>

<p>  Ere thus I will out-braved bee,<br>
    One of us two shall dye:<br>
  I know thee well, an erle thou art;<br>
    Lord Percy, soe am I.</p>

<p>  But trust me, Percy, pittye it were,<br>
    And great offence to kill<br>
  Any of these our guiltlesse men,<br>
    For they have done no ill.</p>

<p>  Let thou and I the battell trye,<br>
    And set our men aside.<br>
  Accurst bee he, Erle Percy sayd,<br>
    By whome this is denyed.</p>

<p>  Then stept a gallant squier forth,<br>
    Witherington was his name,<br>
  Who said, I wold not have it told<br>
    To Henry our king for shame,</p>

<p>  That ere my captaine fought on foote,<br>
    And I stood looking on.<br>
  You be two erles, sayd Witherington,<br>
    And I a squier alone:</p>

<p>  He doe the best that doe I may,<br>
    While I have power to stand:<br>
  While I have power to weeld my sword<br>
    He fight with hart and hand.</p>

<p>  Our English archers bent their bowes,<br>
    Their harts were good and trew;<br>
  Att the first flight of arrowes sent,<br>
    Full four-score Scots they slew.</p>

<p>  Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent,<br>
    As Chieftain stout and good.<br>
  As valiant Captain, all unmov'd<br>
    The shock he firmly stood.</p>

<p>  His host he parted had in three,<br>
    As Leader ware and try'd,<br>
  And soon his spearmen on their foes<br>
    Bare down on every side.</p>

<p>  To drive the deere with hound and horne,<br>
    Douglas bade on the bent<br>
  Two captaines moved with mickle might<br>
    Their speres to shivers went.</p>

<p>  Throughout the English archery<br>
    They dealt full many a wound:<br>
  But still our valiant Englishmen<br>
    All firmly kept their ground:</p>

<p>  And throwing strait their bows away,<br>
    They grasp'd their swords so bright:<br>
  And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,<br>
    On shields and helmets light.</p>

<p>  They closed full fast on every side,<br>
    Noe slackness there was found:<br>
  And many a gallant gentleman<br>
    Lay gasping on the ground.</p>

<p>  O Christ! it was a griefe to see;<br>
    And likewise for to heare,<br>
  The cries of men lying in their gore,<br>
    And scattered here and there.</p>

<p>  At last these two stout erles did meet,<br>
    Like captaines of great might:<br>
  Like lyons wood, they layd on lode,<br>
    And made a cruell fight:</p>

<p>  They fought untill they both did sweat,<br>
    With swords of tempered steele;<br>
  Untill the blood, like drops of rain,<br>
    They tricklin downe did feele.</p>

<p>  Yeeld thee, Lord Percy, Douglas sayd<br>
    In faith I will thee bringe,<br>
  Where thou shalt high advanced bee<br>
    By James our Scottish king:</p>

<p>  Thy ransome I will freely give,<br>
    And this report of thee,<br>
  Thou art the most couragious knight,<br>
    That ever I did see.</p>

<p>  Noe, Douglas, quoth Erle Percy then,<br>
    Thy proffer I doe scorne;<br>
  I will not yeelde to any Scott,<br>
    That ever yett was borne.</p>

<p>  With that, there came an arrow keene<br>
    Out of an English bow,<br>
  Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,<br>
    A deepe and deadlye blow:</p>

<p>  Who never spake more words than these,<br>
    Fight on, my merry men all;<br>
  For why, my life is at an end;<br>
    Lord Percy sees my fall.</p>

<p>  Then leaving liffe, Erie Percy tooke<br>
    The dead man by the hand;<br>
  And said, Erle Douglas, for thy life<br>
    Wold I had lost my land.</p>

<p>  O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed<br>
    With sorrow for thy sake;<br>
  For sure, a more redoubted knight<br>
    Mischance cold never take.</p>

<p>  A knight amongst the Scotts there was<br>
    Which saw Erle Douglas dye,<br>
  Who streight in wrath did vow revenge<br>
    Upon the Lord Percye:</p>

<p>  Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he call'd,<br>
    Who, with a spere most bright,<br>
  Well-mounted on a gallant steed,<br>
    Ran fiercely through the fight;</p>

<p>  And past the English archers all,<br>
    Without all dread or feare;<br>
  And through Earl Percyes body then<br>
    He thrust his hatefull spere;</p>

<p>  With such a vehement force and might<br>
    He did his body gore,<br>
  The staff ran through the other side<br>
    A large cloth-yard and more.</p>

<p>  So thus did both these nobles dye,<br>
    Whose courage none could staine:<br>
  An English archer then perceiv'd<br>
    The noble erle was slaine;</p>

<p>  He had a bow bent in his hand,<br>
    Made of a trusty tree;<br>
  An arrow of a cloth-yard long<br>
    Up to the head drew hee:</p>

<p>  Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<br>
    So right the shaft he sett,<br>
  The grey goose-winge that was thereon,<br>
    In his harts bloode was wette.</p>

<p>  This fight did last from breake of day,<br>
    Till setting of the sun;<br>
  For when they rang the evening-bell,<br>
    The battel scarce was done.</p>

<p>  With stout Erle Percy there was slaine<br>
    Sir John of Egerton,<br>
  Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,<br>
    Sir James that bold barr&ograve;n:</p>

<p>  And with Sir George and stout Sir James,<br>
    Both knights of good account,<br>
  Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slaine,<br>
    Whose prowesse did surmount.</p>

<p>  For Witherington needs must I wayle,<br>
    As one in doleful dumpes;<br>
  For when his leggs were smitten off,<br>
    He fought upon his stumpes.</p>

<p>  And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine<br>
    Sir Hugh Montgomerye,<br>
  Sir Charles Murray, that from the feeld<br>
    One foote wold never flee.</p>

<p>  Sir Charles Murray, of Ratcliff, too,<br>
    His sisters sonne was hee;<br>
  Sir David Lamb, so well esteem'd,<br>
    Yet saved cold not bee.</p>

<p>  And the Lord Maxwell in like case<br>
    Did with Erle Douglas dye:<br>
  Of twenty hundred Scottish speres,<br>
    Scarce fifty-five did flye.</p>

<p>  Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,<br>
    Went home but fifty-three;<br>
  The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,<br>
    Under the greene woode tree.</p>

<p>  Next day did many widowes come,<br>
    Their husbands to bewayle;<br>
  They washt their wounds in brinish teares,<br>
    But all wold not prevayle.</p>

<p>  Theyr bodyes, bathed in purple gore,<br>
    They bare with them away:<br>
  They kist them dead a thousand times,<br>
    Ere they were cladd in clay.</p>

<p>  The news was brought to Eddenborrow,<br>
    Where Scottlands king did raigne,<br>
  That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye<br>
    Was with an arrow slaine:</p>

<p>  O heavy newes, King James did say,<br>
    Scotland may witnesse bee,<br>
  I have not any captaine more<br>
    Of such account as hee.</p>

<p>  Like tydings to King Henry came,<br>
    Within as short a space,<br>
  That Percy of Northumberland<br>
    Was slaine in Chevy-Chace:</p>

<p>  Now God be with him, said our king,<br>
    Sith it will noe better bee;<br>
  I trust I have, within my realme,<br>
    Five hundred as good as hee:</p>

<p>  Yett shall not Scotts nor Scotland say,<br>
    But I will vengeance take:<br>
  I'll be revenged on them all,<br>
    For brave Erle Percyes sake.</p>

<p>  This vow full well the king perform'd<br>
    After, at Humbledowne;<br>
  In one day, fifty knights were slayne,<br>
    With lords of great renowne:</p>

<p>  And of the rest, of small acount,<br>
    Did many thousands dye:<br>
  Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chase,<br>
    Made by the Erle Percy.</p>

<p>  God save our king, and bless this land<br>
    With plenty, joy, and peace;<br>
  And grant henceforth, that foule debate<br>
    'Twixt noblemen may cease.</p>

<br><br>

<p>  When Arthur first in court began,<br>
    And was approved king,<br>
   By force of armes great victorys wanne,<br>
  And conquest home did bring,</p>

<p>  Then into England straight he came<br>
    With fifty good and able<br>
  Knights, that resorted unto him,<br>
    And were of his round table:</p>

<p>  And he had justs and turnaments,<br>
    Whereto were many prest,<br>
  Wherein some knights did far excell<br>
    And eke surmount the rest.</p>

<p>  But one Sir Lancelot du Lake,<br>
    Who was approved well,<br>
  He for his deeds and feats of armes<br>
    All others did excell.</p>

<p>  When he had rested him a while,<br>
    In play, and game, and sportt,<br>
  He said he wold goe prove himselfe<br>
    In some adventurous sort.</p>

<p>  He armed rode in a forrest wide,<br>
    And met a damsell faire,<br>
  Who told him of adventures great,<br>
    Whereto he gave great eare.</p>

<p>  Such wold I find, quoth Lancelott:<br>
    For that cause came I hither.<br>
  Thou seemest, quoth shee, a knight full good,<br>
    And I will bring thee thither.</p>

<p>  Wheras a mighty knight doth dwell,<br>
    That now is of great fame:<br>
  Therefore tell me what wight thou art,<br>
    And what may be thy name.</p>

<p>  "My name is Lancelot du Lake."<br>
    Quoth she, it likes me than:<br>
  Here dwelles a knight who never was<br>
    Yet matcht with any man:</p>

<p>  Who has in prison threescore knights<br>
    And four, that he did wound;<br>
  Knights of King Arthurs court they be,<br>
    And of his table round.</p>

<p>  She brought him to a river side,<br>
    And also to a tree,<br>
  Whereon a copper bason hung,<br>
    And many shields to see.</p>

<p>  He struck soe hard, the bason broke;<br>
    And Tarquin soon he spyed:<br>
  Who drove a horse before him fast,<br>
    Whereon a knight lay tyed.</p>

<p>  Sir knight, then sayd Sir Lancelett,<br>
    Bring me that horse-load hither,<br>
  And lay him downe, and let him rest;<br>
    Weel try our force together:</p>

<p>  For, as I understand, thou hast,<br>
    So far as thou art able,<br>
  Done great despite and shame unto<br>
    The knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>  If thou be of the Table Round,<br>
    Quoth Tarquin speedilye,<br>
  Both thee and all thy fellowship<br>
    I utterly defye.</p>

<p>  That's over much, quoth Lancelott tho,<br>
    Defend thee by and by.<br>
  They sett their speares unto their steeds,<br>
    And eache att other flie.</p>

<p>  They coucht theire speares (their horses ran,<br>
    As though there had beene thunder),<br>
  And strucke them each immidst their shields,<br>
    Wherewith they broke in sunder.</p>

<p>  Their horsses backes brake under them,<br>
    The knights were both astound:<br>
  To avoyd their horsses they made haste<br>
    And light upon the ground.</p>

<p>  They tooke them to their shields full fast,<br>
    Their swords they drewe out than,<br>
  With mighty strokes most eagerlye<br>
    Each at the other ran.</p>

<p>  They wounded were, and bled full sore,<br>
    They both for breath did stand,<br>
  And leaning on their swords awhile,<br>
    Quoth Tarquine, Hold thy hand,</p>

<p>  And tell to me what I shall aske.<br>
    Say on, quoth Lancelot tho.<br>
  Thou art, quoth Tarquine, the best knight<br>
    That ever I did know:</p>

<p>  And like a knight, that I did hate:<br>
    Soe that thou be not hee,<br>
  I will deliver all the rest,<br>
    And eke accord with thee.</p>

<p>  That is well said, quoth Lancelott;<br>
    But sith it must be soe,<br>
  What knight is that thou hatest thus<br>
    I pray thee to me show.</p>

<p>  His name is Lancelot du Lake,<br>
    He slew my brother deere;<br>
  Him I suspect of all the rest:<br>
    I would I had him here.</p>

<p>  Thy wish thou hast, but yet unknowne,<br>
    I am Lancelot du Lake,<br>
  Now knight of Arthurs Table Round;<br>
    King Hauds son of Schuwake;</p>

<p>  And I desire thee to do thy worst.<br>
    Ho, ho, quoth Tarquin tho'<br>
  One of us two shall ende our lives<br>
    Before that we do go.</p>

<p>  If thou be Lancelot du Lake,<br>
    Then welcome shalt thou bee:<br>
  Wherfore see thou thyself defend,<br>
    For now defye I thee.</p>

<p>  They buckled them together so,<br>
    Like unto wild boares rashing;<br>
  And with their swords and shields they ran<br>
    At one another slashing:</p>

<p>  The ground besprinkled was with blood:<br>
    Tarquin began to yield;<br>
  For he gave backe for wearinesse,<br>
    And lowe did beare his shield.</p>

<p>  This soone Sir Lancelot espyde,<br>
    He leapt upon him then,<br>
  He pull'd him downe upon his knee,<br>
    And rushing off his helm,</p>

<p>  Forthwith he strucke his necke in two,<br>
    And, when he had soe done,<br>
  From prison threescore knights and four<br>
    Delivered everye one.</p>

    I praye thee to shew to mee."</p>

<p>  "To Drayton Basset woldst thou goe,<br>
    Fro the place where thou dost stand?<br>
  The next payre of gallowes thou comest unto,<br>
    Turne in upon thy right hand."</p>

<p>  That is an unreadye waye, sayd our king,<br>
    Thou doest but jest, I see;<br>
  Nowe shewe me out the nearest waye,<br>
    And I pray thee wend with mee.</p>

<p>  Away with a vengeance! quoth the tanner:<br>
    I hold thee out of thy witt:<br>
  All daye have I rydden on Brocke my mare,<br>
    And I am fasting yett.</p>

<p>  "Go with me downe to Drayton Basset,<br>
    No daynties we will spare;<br>
  All daye shalt thou eate and drinke of the best,<br>
    And I will paye thy fare."</p>

<p>  Gramercye for nothing, the tanner replyde,<br>
    Thou payest no fare of mine:<br>
  I trowe I've more nobles in my purse,<br>
    Than thou hast pence in thine.</p>

<p>  God give thee joy of them, sayd the king,<br>
    And send them well to priefe.<br>
  The tanner wolde faine have beene away,<br>
    For he weende he had beene a thiefe.</p>

<p>  What art thou, hee sayde, thou fine fellowe,<br>
    Of thee I am in great feare,<br>
  For the clothes, thou wearest upon thy back,<br>
    Might beseeme a lord to weare.</p>

<p>  I never stole them, quoth our king,<br>
    I tell you, Sir, by the roode.<br>
  "Then thou playest, as many an unthrift doth,<br>
    And standest in midds of thy goode."</p>

<p>  What tydinges heare you, sayd the kynge,<br>
    As you ryde farre and neare?<br>
  "I heare no tydinges, Sir, by the masse,<br>
    But that cowe-hides are deare."</p>

<p>  "Cow-hides! cow-hides! what things are those?<br>
     I marvell what they bee?"<br>
  What, art thou a foole? the tanner reply'd;<br>
    I carry one under mee.</p>

<p>  What craftsman art thou, said the king,<br>
    I pray thee tell me trowe.<br>
  "I am a barker, Sir, by my trade;<br>
    Nowe tell me what art thou?"</p>

<p>  I am a poor courtier, Sir, quoth he,<br>
    That am forth of service worne;<br>
  And faine I wolde thy prentise bee,<br>
    Thy cunninge for to learne.</p>

<p>  Marrye heaven forfend, the tanner replyde,<br>
    That thou my prentise were:<br>
  Thou woldst spend more good than I shold winne<br>
    By fortye shilling a yere.</p>

<p>  Yet one thinge wolde I, sayd our king,<br>
    If thou wilt not seeme strange:<br>
  Thoughe my horse be better than thy mare,<br>
    Yet with thee I fain wold change.</p>

<p>  "Why if with me thou faine wilt change,<br>
    As change full well maye wee,<br>
  By the faith of my bodye, thou proude fellowe<br>
    I will have some boot of thee."</p>

<p>  That were against reason, sayd the king,<br>
    I sweare, so mote I thee:<br>
  My horse is better than thy mare,<br>
    And that thou well mayst see.</p>

<p>  "Yea, Sir, but Brocke is gentle and mild,<br>
    And softly she will fare:<br>
  Thy horse is unrulye and wild, I wiss;<br>
    Aye skipping here and theare."</p>

<p>  What boote wilt thou have? our king reply'd;<br>
    Now tell me in this stound.<br>
  "Noe pence, nor halfpence, by my faye,<br>
    But a noble in gold so round.</p>

<p>  "Here's twentye groates of white moneye,<br>
    Sith thou will have it of mee."<br>
  I would have sworne now, quoth the tanner,<br>
    Thou hadst not had one pennie.</p>

<p>  But since we two have made a change,<br>
    A change we must abide,<br>
  Although thou hast gotten Brocke my mare,<br>
    Thou gettest not my cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  I will not have it, sayd the kynge,<br>
    I sweare, so mought I thee;<br>
  Thy foule cowe-hide I wolde not beare,<br>
    If thou woldst give it to mee.</p>

<p>  The tanner hee tooke his good cowe-hide,<br>
    That of the cow was bilt;<br>
  And threwe it upon the king's sadelle,<br>
    That was soe fayrelye gilte.<br>
  "Now help me up, thou fine fellowe,<br>
    'Tis time that I were gone:<br>
  When I come home to Gyllian my wife,<br>
    Sheel say I am a gentilmon."</p>

<p>  The king he tooke him up by the legge;<br>
    The tanner a f----- lett fall.<br>
  Nowe marrye, good fellowe, sayd the king,<br>
    Thy courtesye is but small.</p>

<p>  When the tanner he was in the kinges sad&egrave;lle,<br>
    And his foote in the stirrup was;<br>
  He marvelled greatlye in his minde,<br>
    Whether it were golde or brass.</p>

<p>  But when the steede saw the cows taile wagge,<br>
    And eke the blacke cowe-horne;<br>
  He stamped, and stared, and awaye he ranne,<br>
    As the devill had him borne.</p>

<p>  The tanner he pulld, the tanner he sweat,<br>
    And held by the pummil fast:<br>
  At length the tanner came tumbling downe;<br>
    His necke he had well-nye brast.</p>

<p>  Take thy horse again with a vengeance, he sayd,<br>
    With mee he shall not byde.<br>
  "My horse wolde have borne thee well enoughe,<br>
    But he knewe not of thy cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  Yet if againe thou faine woldst change,<br>
    As change full well may wee,<br>
  By the faith of my bodye, thou jolly tann&egrave;r,<br>
    I will have some boote of thee."</p>

<p>  What boote wilt thou have? the tanner replyd,<br>
    Nowe tell me in this stounde.<br>
  "Noe pence nor halfpence, Sir, by my faye,<br>
    But I will have twentye pound."</p>

<p>  "Here's twentye groates out of my purse;<br>
    And twentye I have of thine:<br>
  And I have one more, which we will spend<br>
    Together at the wine."</p>

<p>  The king set a bugle home to his mouthe,<br>
    And blewe both loude and shrille:<br>
  And soone came lords, and soone came knights,<br>
    Fast ryding over the hille.</p>

<p>  Nowe, out alas! the tanner he cryde,<br>
    That ever I sawe this daye!<br>
  Thou art a strong thiefe, yon come thy fellowes<br>
    Will beare my cowe-hide away.</p>

<p>  They are no thieves, the king replyde,<br>
    I sweare, soe mote I thee:<br>
  But they are the lords of the north countr&egrave;y,<br>
    Here come to hunt with mee.</p>

<p>  And soone before our king they came,<br>
    And knelt downe on the grounde:<br>
  Then might the tanner have beene awaye,<br>
    He had lever than twentye pounde.</p>

<p>  A coller, a coller, here: sayd the king,<br>
    A coller he loud gan crye:<br>
  Then woulde he lever than twentye pound,<br>
    He had not beene so nighe.</p>

<p>  A coller, a coller, the tanner he sayd,<br>
    I trowe it will breed sorrowe:<br>
  After a coller cometh a halter,<br>
    I trow I shall be hang'd to-morrowe.</p>

<p>  Be not afraid, tanner, said our king;<br>
    I tell thee, so mought I thee,<br>
  Lo here I make thee the best esquire<br>
    That is in the North countrie.</p>

<p>  For Plumpton-parke I will give thee,<br>
    With tenements faire beside:<br>
  'Tis worth three hundred markes by the yeare,<br>
    To maintaine thy good cowe-hide.</p>

<p>  Gramercye, my liege, the tanner replyde,<br>
    For the favour thou hast me showne;<br>
  If ever thou comest to merry Tamw&ograve;rth,<br>
    Neates leather shall clout thy shoen.</p>

<p>  It was intill a pleasant time,<br>
    Upon a simmer's day,<br>
  The noble Earl of Mar's daughter<br>
  Went forth to sport and play.</p>

<p>  As thus she did amuse hersell,<br>
    Below a green aik tree,<br>
  There she saw a sprightly doo<br>
    Set on a tower sae hie.</p>

<p>  "O cow-me-doo, my love sae true,<br>
    If ye'll come down to me,<br>
  Ye 'se hae a cage o guid red gowd<br>
    Instead o simple tree:</p>

<p>  "I'll put growd hingers roun your cage,<br>
    And siller roun your wa;<br>
  I'll gar ye shine as fair a bird<br>
    As ony o them a'."</p>

<p>  But she hadnae these words well spoke,<br>
    Nor yet these words well said,<br>
  Till Cow-me-doo flew frae the tower<br>
    And lighted on her head.</p>

<p>  Then she has brought this pretty bird<br>
    Hame to her bowers and ba,<br>
  And made him shine as fair a bird<br>
    As ony o them a'.</p>

<p>  When day was gane, and night was come,<br>
    About the evening tide,<br>
  This lady spied a sprightly youth<br>
    Stand straight up by her side.</p>

<p>  "From whence came ye, young man?" she said;<br>
    "That does surprise me sair;<br>
  My door was bolted right secure,<br>
    What way hae ye come here?"</p>

<p>  "O had your tongue, ye lady fair,<br>
    Lat a' your folly be;<br>
  Mind ye not on your turtle-doo<br>
    Last day ye brought wi thee?"</p>

<p>  "O tell me mair, young man," she said,<br>
    "This does surprise me now;<br>
  What country hae ye come frae?<br>
    What pedigree are you?"</p>

<p>  "My mither lives on foreign isles,<br>
    She has nae mair but me;<br>
  She is a queen o wealth and state,<br>
    And birth and high degree.</p>

<p>  "Likewise well skilld in magic spells,<br>
    As ye may plainly see,<br>
  And she transformd me to yon shape,<br>
    To charm such maids as thee.</p>

<p>  "I am a doo the live-lang day,<br>
    A sprightly youth at night;<br>
  This aye gars me appear mair fair<br>
    In a fair maiden's sight.</p>

<p>  "And it was but this verra day<br>
    That I came ower the sea;<br>
  Your lovely face did me enchant;<br>
    I'll live and dee wi thee."</p>

<p>  "O Cow-me-doo, my luve sae true,<br>
    Nae mair frae me ye 'se gae;<br>
  That's never my intent, my luve,<br>
    As ye said, it shall be sae."</p>

<p>  "O Cow-me-doo, my luve sae true,<br>
    It's time to gae to bed;"<br>
  "Wi a' my heart, my dear marrow,<br>
    It's be as ye hae said."</p>

<p>  Then he has staid in bower wi her<br>
    For sax lang years and ane,<br>
  Till sax young sons to him she bare,<br>
    And the seventh she's brought hame.</p>

<p>  But aye as ever a child was born<br>
    He carried them away,<br>
  And brought them to his mither's care,<br>
    As fast as he coud fly.</p>

<p>  Thus he has staid in bower wi her<br>
    For twenty years and three;<br>
  There came a lord o high renown<br>
    To court this fair ladie.</p>

<p>  But still his proffer she refused,<br>
    And a' his presents too;<br>
  Says, I'm content to live alane<br>
    Wi my bird, Cow-me-doo.</p>

<p>  Her father sware a solemn oath<br>
    Amang the nobles all,<br>
  "The morn, or ere I eat or drink,<br>
    This bird I will gar kill."</p>

<p>  The bird was sitting in his cage,<br>
    And heard what they did say;<br>
  And when he found they were dismist,<br>
    Says, Wae's me for this day!</p>

<p>  "Before that I do langer stay,<br>
    And thus to be forlorn,<br>
  I'll gang unto my mither's bower,<br>
    Where I was bred and born."</p>

<p>  Then Cow-me-doo took flight and flew<br>
    Beyond the raging sea,<br>
  And lighted near his mither's castle,<br>
    On a tower o gowd sae hie.</p>

<p>  As his mither was wauking out,<br>
    To see what she coud see,<br>
  And there she saw her little son,<br>
    Set on the tower sae hie.</p>

<p>  "Get dancers here to dance," she said,<br>
    "And minstrells for to play;<br>
  For here's my young son, Florentine,<br>
    Come here wi me to stay."</p>

<p>  "Get nae dancers to dance, mither,<br>
    Nor minstrells for to play,<br>
  For the mither o my seven sons,<br>
    The morn's her wedding-day."</p>

<p>  "O tell me, tell me, Florentine,<br>
    Tell me, and tell me true,<br>
  Tell me this day without a flaw,<br>
    What I will do for you."</p>

<p>  "Instead of dancers to dance, mither,<br>
    Or minstrells for to play,<br>
  Turn four-and-twenty wall-wight men<br>
    Like storks in feathers gray;</p>

<p>  "My seven sons in seven swans,<br>
    Aboon their heads to flee;<br>
  And I mysell a gay gos-hawk,<br>
    A bird o high degree."</p>

<p>  Then sichin said the queen hersell,<br>
    "That thing's too high for me;"<br>
  But she applied to an auld woman,<br>
    Who had mair skill than she.</p>

<p>  Instead o dancers to dance a dance,<br>
    Or minstrells for to play,<br>
  Four-and-twenty wall-wight men<br>
    Turnd birds o feathers gray;</p>

<p>  Her seven sons in seven swans,<br>
    Aboon their heads to flee;<br>
  And he himsell a gay gos-hawk,<br>
    A bird o high degree.</p>

<p>  This flock o birds took flight and flew<br>
    Beyond the raging sea,<br>
  And landed near the Earl Mar's castle,<br>
    Took shelter in every tree.</p>

<p>  They were a flock o pretty birds,<br>
    Right comely to be seen;<br>
  The people viewed them wi surprise,<br>
    As they dancd on the green.</p>

<p>  These birds ascended frae the tree<br>
    And lighted on the ha,<br>
  And at the last wi force did flee<br>
    Amang the nobles a'.</p>

<p>  The storks there seized some o the men,<br>
    They coud neither fight nor flee;<br>
  The swans they bound the bride's best man<br>
    Below a green aik tree.</p>

<p>  They lighted next on maidens fair,<br>
    Then on the bride's own head,<br>
  And wi the twinkling o an ee<br>
    The bride and them were fled.</p>

<p>  There's ancient men at weddings been<br>
    For sixty years or more,<br>
  But sic a curious wedding-day<br>
    They never saw before.</p>

<p>  For naething coud the companie do.<br>
    Nor naething coud they say<br>
  But they saw a flock o pretty birds<br>
    That took their bride away.</p>

<p>  When that Earl Mar he came to know<br>
    Where his dochter did stay,<br>
  He signd a bond o unity,<br>
    And visits now they pay.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
